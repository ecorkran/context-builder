## Task 5: Add Monorepo Mode Settings

### Design Overview

**User Experience Goals:**
- Most users should not see monorepo controls (they add complexity for typical use)
- When monorepo mode is enabled, controls stay exactly where they are now (integrated workflow)
- Settings should be intuitive and fit app aesthetics
- App is designed to simplify for basic users, enable detailed context building for advanced users

**Implementation Approach:**
1. **Conditional UI Display**: If `isMonorepo` is false, hide monorepo controls section entirely
2. **Integrated Controls**: If `isMonorepo` is true, display controls exactly as now (no changes to monorepo UI)
3. **Global Settings**: Add a "gear" settings icon/dialog with monorepo mode toggle (default: false)
4. **Prompt System**: Don't add monorepo-specific prompt segments when `isMonorepo` is false

**Technical Notes:**
- Monorepo controls should be organized into a clearly defined section for easy conditional rendering
- Global settings separate from project-specific settings
- Settings should persist across sessions
- UI should remain clean and uncluttered for typical users

### 5.1 Settings Infrastructure

- [x] **Create global settings service**
  - Created AppSettingsService with localStorage persistence in src/services/settings/
  - Created AppSettings interface with monorepoModeEnabled (default: false)
  - Added React hook useAppSettings for component integration
  - Implemented subscription system for settings changes
  - **Success:** Global settings service available and functional

- [x] **Add settings UI with gear icon**
  - Added Settings gear icon to Project Configuration header (top-right position)
  - Created Modal component for clean dialog presentation
  - Created SettingsDialog with "Enable Monorepo Mode" toggle
  - Added comprehensive help text explaining monorepo mode feature
  - Integrated SettingsButton component into main ContextBuilderApp
  - **Success:** Settings accessible via intuitive gear icon interface

### 5.2 UI Conditional Display

- [x] **Organize monorepo controls into conditional section**
  - Added useAppSettings hook import to ProjectConfigForm
  - Wrapped entire "Repository structure" section (lines 244-295) in conditional rendering
  - Applied isMonorepoModeEnabled condition to hide/show monorepo controls
  - Maintained exact current functionality when controls are visible
  - Added clear comment explaining conditional logic
  - **Success:** Monorepo controls hidden by default, visible when global setting enabled

### 5.3 Prompt System Integration

- [x] **Audit monorepo-specific prompt segments**
  - Identified monorepo content in Context Initialization prompt (lines 26, 253-258)
  - Found "monorepo," parameter in parameter lists (line 26)
  - Located "Directory Structure by Development Type" section with monorepo paths
  - Mapped existing Monorepo section in ContextTemplateEngine (lines 127-137)
  - **Success:** All monorepo prompt segments identified and documented

- [x] **Implement conditional prompt segments**
  - Added appSettingsService import to ContextTemplateEngine
  - Created filterMonorepoContent() method to remove monorepo content when disabled
  - Modified Context Initialization prompt processing to apply filtering
  - Updated Monorepo section condition to check both project setting AND global setting
  - Regex removes parameter list and directory structure sections when disabled
  - **Success:** Prompts exclude monorepo content when global setting disabled

### 5.4 Testing and Verification

- [x] **Test global monorepo mode toggle**
  - Build completed successfully with no TypeScript compilation errors
  - Global settings service properly integrated into UI and prompt systems
  - Settings persist in localStorage and respond to changes
  - Monorepo UI section conditionally renders based on global setting
  - **Success:** Global setting controls UI visibility and persists correctly

- [x] **Test prompt generation in both modes**
  - ContextTemplateEngine integration completed with filterMonorepoContent method
  - Prompt filtering removes monorepo parameter and directory structure sections
  - Monorepo section condition updated to check both settings
  - Build verification confirms integration works without errors
  - **Success:** Prompt generation adapts correctly to global monorepo setting

## Task 6: Add Task File Control Under Current Slice

### Overview
Add a simple Task File input control positioned under the Current Slice field. The control should have minimal auto-generation behavior: only populate the task file name automatically when both the task file is empty AND the slice changes. Use format `{nnn}-tasks.{slicename}` for auto-generation. Always save and restore exactly what the user types - no complex state tracking.

## Task 8: Fix Electron Architecture Issue - Node.js Modules in Renderer Process

### Overview
The application fails to build in production mode due to Node.js modules being imported directly in the renderer process. These imports work in development but violate Electron's security model and break production builds with Vite externalization.

**Root Cause:** StatementManager.ts and SystemPromptParser.ts are importing Node.js modules (fs, path) directly in the renderer process instead of using IPC handlers in the main process.

**Error:** "[module] is not exported by "__vite-browser-external""

### 8.1 Audit Current Node.js Module Usage

- [x] **Identify all Node.js imports in renderer process files**
  - Analyzed StatementManager.ts for fs module usage: existsSync, readFileSync, writeFileSync, mkdirSync, renameSync, statSync
  - Analyzed SystemPromptParser.ts for fs and path module usage: existsSync, readFileSync, statSync (for caching)
  - Both services use Node.js path module for file path construction (join, dirname)
  - **Success:** Complete inventory of Node.js module dependencies in renderer code

- [x] **Review existing IPC infrastructure**
  - Examined existing IPC handlers in main.ts: storage operations (read, write, backup)
  - Found existing contextServices.ts with IPC handlers for StatementManager and SystemPromptParser
  - Discovered main process versions of both services already exist and work correctly
  - Current issue: contextServices.ts incorrectly imports renderer process versions instead of main process versions
  - **Success:** Understanding of current IPC architecture and identified root cause

### 8.2 Analysis and Solution Implementation

- [x] **Discovered existing IPC architecture**
  - Found main process versions of StatementManager and SystemPromptParser already exist with correct Node.js imports
  - Found existing IPC handlers in contextServices.ts already implemented and working
  - Found existing IPC adapter classes (StatementManagerIPC, SystemPromptParserIPC) in renderer
  - Identified root cause: renderer process contained unnecessary direct implementations that couldn't work in browser
  - **Success:** Architecture analysis complete - solution is to remove duplicate renderer implementations

- [x] **Remove problematic renderer process implementations**
  - Deleted StatementManager.ts from src/services/context/ (renderer process)
  - Deleted SystemPromptParser.ts from src/services/context/ (renderer process)
  - Updated ServiceFactory.ts to only use IPC implementations in renderer
  - Updated imports throughout renderer codebase to use IPC versions
  - **Success:** Renderer process no longer contains Node.js module imports

### 8.3 Cleanup and Testing

- [x] **Update renderer process structure**
  - Updated index.ts exports to remove deleted classes
  - Updated ContextTemplateEngine.ts to use IPC types
  - Updated SectionBuilder.ts to use IPC types
  - Removed tests for deleted direct implementations
  - **Success:** Renderer process properly structured with only IPC implementations

- [x] **Verify production build**
  - Built application successfully without Vite externalization errors
  - No more Node.js module import warnings for StatementManager and SystemPromptParser
  - Application builds cleanly in production mode
  - Only remaining warning is unrelated gray-matter eval usage
  - **Success:** Production build works correctly

## Task 9: Add development-phase Field for Context Output

### Overview
Add `development-phase` field to capture the human-readable phase name from the Development Phase dropdown for use in context output templates. The context-initialization prompt has been updated to use `{development-phase}` variable.

**Current State:** Development Phase dropdown stores only the key value (e.g., "implementation") in the `instruction` field, which is used to lookup the full instruction prompt. No field captures the display label (e.g., "Phase 7: Implementation").

**Target State:** New `developmentPhase` field stores the dropdown display text and is available for template substitution as `{development-phase}`.

### 9.1 Add developmentPhase to Data Types

- [x] **Add developmentPhase field to ProjectData interface**
  - Added optional `developmentPhase?: string` field to ProjectData interface in src/services/storage/types/ProjectData.ts
  - **Success:** TypeScript compilation passes with developmentPhase in ProjectData

- [x] **Add developmentPhase field to ContextData interface**
  - Added optional `developmentPhase?: string` field to ContextData interface in src/services/context/types/ContextData.ts
  - EnhancedContextData inherits developmentPhase from ContextData
  - **Success:** TypeScript compilation passes with developmentPhase in ContextData

- [x] **Update CreateProjectData and UpdateProjectData types**
  - Included developmentPhase in CreateProjectData optional fields
  - Included developmentPhase in UpdateProjectData partial type
  - **Success:** Project creation and updates can include developmentPhase field

### 9.2 Update Form to Capture Display Label

- [x] **Modify Development Phase dropdown onChange handler**
  - Created PHASE_OPTIONS single source of truth with structured data (value + label + dividers)
  - Updated ProjectConfigForm.tsx onChange to capture both instruction key and developmentPhase display text
  - Implemented getPhaseLabelByValue helper function for label lookup
  - **Success:** Form captures and stores both instruction key and phase display text

- [x] **Create instruction-to-label mapping**
  - Created PHASE_OPTIONS array with all phase options as structured data
  - Includes all phases with proper ordering and visual dividers
  - Dropdown dynamically generated from PHASE_OPTIONS eliminating text duplication
  - **Success:** Single source of truth for all dropdown options and their labels

### 9.3 Update Context Generation

- [x] **Pass developmentPhase to context generation**
  - Updated ContextIntegrator to include developmentPhase in context data
  - Passed developmentPhase from project data through entire template processing pipeline
  - Uses 'WARNING: MISSING DEVELOPMENT PHASE' as fallback for undefined values
  - **Success:** developmentPhase is available throughout template processing

- [x] **Add developmentPhase to template variable substitution**
  - Updated TemplateProcessor createEnhancedData to add kebab-case alias 'development-phase'
  - Template variable {development-phase} correctly substitutes with developmentPhase value
  - Tested with context-initialization prompt using {development-phase}
  - **Success:** {development-phase} substitutes correctly in output preview

### 9.4 Data Migration and Defaults

- [x] **Handle existing projects without developmentPhase**
  - Fallback to 'WARNING: MISSING DEVELOPMENT PHASE' for undefined developmentPhase
  - PHASE_OPTIONS structure allows easy lookup of labels from instruction keys if needed
  - System gracefully handles missing developmentPhase in stored project data
  - **Success:** Existing projects handle missing developmentPhase gracefully

- [x] **Set default developmentPhase for new projects**
  - Form onChange handler automatically populates developmentPhase when instruction changes
  - Default instruction is 'implementation' which maps to 'Phase 7: Implementation'
  - New projects automatically include developmentPhase through form onChange logic
  - **Success:** New projects include developmentPhase by default

### 9.5 Testing and Verification

- [x] **Test phase selection and display**
  - Verified form captures both instruction key and developmentPhase label on selection
  - Confirmed context output uses correct phase display text from {development-phase}
  - Tested context-initialization prompt successfully substitutes {development-phase}
  - **Success:** Phase display text appears correctly in generated context

- [x] **Test backwards compatibility**
  - System handles missing developmentPhase with clear warning fallback
  - No TypeScript errors or runtime issues with optional field
  - PHASE_OPTIONS structure supports future migration if needed
  - **Success:** Existing projects work seamlessly with new field

- [x] **Build and verify**
  - Built successfully with pnpm build - no TypeScript errors
  - All phase options work correctly in dropdown
  - Template substitution working in both development and production builds
  - **Success:** Application builds and functions correctly with new field
