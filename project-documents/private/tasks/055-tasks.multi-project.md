# Task Breakdown: Multi-Project Support

## Context Summary

This slice adds multi-project functionality to the existing single-project context-builder application. We will implement this in two phases: first using existing manta-templates controls (Select + Button components) for immediate functionality, then later developing an enhanced ProjectSelector component for the final refined UX.

The implementation leverages existing robust infrastructure:
- ✅ PersistentProjectStore with complete CRUD operations
- ✅ Auto-save system working per-project  
- ✅ Context generation system
- ✅ Form state management

**Key Approach:** Extension over replacement - add multi-project layer on top of proven single-project system without disrupting existing workflows.
