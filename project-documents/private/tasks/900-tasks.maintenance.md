# Maintenance Tasks: context-builder

## Task 1: TIPropertyValueIsValid macOS Error Resolution

### 1.1 Error Analysis and Documentation

- [x] **Research TIPropertyValueIsValid error causes**
  - Identify error as macOS Text Input Manager (TIM) property conflict
  - Determine error occurs with non-English input methods
  - Confirm no functional impact on application
  - **Success:** Error root cause identified and documented

- [x] **Document error characteristics**
  - Log specific error messages and patterns
  - Identify triggering conditions (input method switching)
  - Confirm Electron application scope
  - **Success:** Complete error profile documented

- [ ] **Create developer documentation**
  - Add known issue section to development docs
  - Include error description and non-critical status
  - Provide user workaround instructions
  - **Success:** Developers aware of issue and can inform users

### 1.2 Solution Evaluation

- [x] **Evaluate potential solutions**
  - Research input method switching workaround
  - Investigate Electron configuration options
  - Assess console filtering approaches
  - **Success:** Solution options identified and evaluated

- [ ] **Risk assessment for each solution**
  - Document implementation complexity
  - Assess potential for introducing new issues
  - Evaluate maintenance overhead
  - **Success:** Clear risk/benefit analysis for each approach

- [ ] **Recommend approach**
  - Select documentation-only approach given low impact
  - Justify decision based on risk/benefit analysis
  - Outline future monitoring strategy
  - **Success:** Clear recommendation with rationale

### 1.3 Implementation (Documentation Approach)

- [ ] **Update development documentation**
  - Add to troubleshooting section of developer docs
  - Include user guidance for eliminating warnings
  - Document as known limitation with no functional impact
  - **Success:** Documentation updated with issue information

- [ ] **Create user guidance**
  - Document input method switching workaround
  - Explain cosmetic nature of warnings
  - Provide reassurance about lack of functional impact
  - **Success:** Users can resolve warnings if desired

- [ ] **Add to maintenance tasks log**
  - Log warning in maintenance-tasks.md per project guidelines
  - Include checkbox format as specified
  - Reference this maintenance slice
  - **Success:** Warning properly logged in maintenance system

### 1.4 Verification and Monitoring

- [ ] **Test documentation accuracy**
  - Verify workaround instructions work
  - Confirm error description matches observed behavior
  - Test across different macOS versions if possible
  - **Success:** Documentation verified accurate

- [ ] **Set up monitoring strategy**
  - Define process for checking Electron updates
  - Monitor for upstream fixes to framework
  - Track user reports of similar issues
  - **Success:** Monitoring strategy established

## Task 2: Maintenance Infrastructure Setup

### 2.1 Maintenance Documentation

- [x] **Create maintenance slice structure**
  - Created 900-slice.maintenance.md with proper YAML frontmatter
  - Documented TIPropertyValueIsValid analysis
  - Established maintenance patterns for future issues
  - **Success:** Maintenance slice created and documented

- [x] **Create maintenance task structure**
  - Created 900-tasks.maintenance.md with checklist format
  - Organized tasks by logical groupings with success criteria
  - Established pattern for future maintenance tasks
  - **Success:** Task tracking structure established

- [ ] **Update slice plan to include maintenance**
  - Add maintenance phase to 003-slices.context-builder.md
  - Reference 900-slice.maintenance.md
  - Document maintenance workflow
  - **Success:** Maintenance formally part of project plan

### 2.2 Process Documentation

- [ ] **Document maintenance workflow**
  - Define how maintenance issues are identified
  - Establish triage and prioritization process
  - Create templates for future maintenance slices
  - **Success:** Clear process for handling maintenance items

- [ ] **Establish maintenance scheduling**
  - Define regular maintenance review cadence
  - Create checklist for routine maintenance tasks
  - Establish criteria for creating new maintenance slices
  - **Success:** Maintenance becomes regular part of development cycle

## Success Summary

Upon completion of these tasks:
- TIPropertyValueIsValid error will be properly documented as a known, non-critical issue
- Users and developers will have clear guidance on the cosmetic nature of the warnings
- Maintenance infrastructure will be established for future issues
- Project will have a systematic approach to handling ongoing maintenance needs

## Notes

**Priority:** P2 - Non-critical maintenance work
**Risk Level:** Low - Primarily documentation and process work
**Dependencies:** None - can be completed independently
**Testing:** Verification of documentation accuracy, no functional testing required
