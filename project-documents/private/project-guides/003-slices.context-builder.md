# Slice Plan: context-builder

## Foundation Work

1. [ ] **Electron Application Setup**
   - Note: this should already be done, just verify.
   - Initialize Electron project with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
   - Configure development environment with hot reload
   - Set up build pipeline and basic window management
   - **Success:** Application launches with basic window and React renders

2. [ ] **manta-templates Integration** 
   - Note: this should already be done, just verify.
   - Integrate manta-templates ui-core component library
   - Configure Tailwind with existing design tokens
   - Set up Radix UI component primitives
   - **Success:** Basic UI components render and match design system

3. [ ] **Core Layout Structure**
   - Implement split-pane layout (controls left, output right)
   - Create responsive window sizing and layout management
   - Basic application shell with title bar and menu structure
   - **Success:** Layout responds correctly to window resizing

4. [ ] **Local Storage Foundation**
   - Set up JSON-based file storage in app data directory
   - Create basic CRUD operations for project data
   - Implement data serialization and error handling
   - **Success:** Data persists between application sessions

## Feature Slices (in implementation order)

1. [ ] **Basic Context Generation** - Core template assembly and output display
   - **User Value:** User can generate a basic context prompt for Claude Code
   - **Success Criteria:** 
     - Static template renders in output panel
     - Basic variable substitution works (project name, template, slice)
     - Output formatting matches Claude Code requirements
   - **Dependencies:** Foundation work complete
   - **Interfaces:** Provides ContextGenerator service for other slices
   - **Risk Level:** Medium (core business logic)

2. [ ] **Project Configuration Management** - Single project setup and editing
   - **User Value:** User can configure project parameters (name, template, slice, monorepo status)
   - **Success Criteria:**
     - Form controls for all project parameters
     - Real-time validation and feedback
     - Configuration persists between sessions
   - **Dependencies:** Basic Context Generation, Local Storage Foundation
   - **Interfaces:** Provides ProjectService for project switching slice
   - **Risk Level:** Low (standard form handling)

3. [ ] **Multi-Project Support** - Project switching and management
   - **User Value:** User can manage multiple projects and switch between them
   - **Success Criteria:**
     - Project dropdown with selection functionality
     - Project state switches completely when selection changes
     - Create/delete project operations
     - Each project maintains independent configuration
   - **Dependencies:** Project Configuration Management
   - **Interfaces:** Consumes ProjectService, integrates with all other slices
   - **Risk Level:** Medium (state management complexity)

4. [ ] **Template Selection System** - System prompt template integration
   - **User Value:** User can select from predefined instruction templates
   - **Success Criteria:**
     - Template dropdown with available system prompts
     - Template metadata display (description, phase information)
     - Selected template integrates into context generation
     - Templates load from existing prompt.ai-project.system.md structure
   - **Dependencies:** Basic Context Generation
   - **Interfaces:** Extends ContextGenerator with template selection
   - **Risk Level:** Low (template loading and selection)

5. [ ] **Context Customization** - User input areas and real-time preview
   - **User Value:** User can add custom notes and see real-time context preview
   - **Success Criteria:**
     - Text areas for recent events and additional notes
     - Real-time preview updates as user types
     - Input validation and character limits
     - Generated context updates immediately with user input
   - **Dependencies:** Basic Context Generation, Template Selection System
   - **Interfaces:** Integrates with ContextGenerator for dynamic updates
   - **Risk Level:** Low (form inputs and real-time updates)

## Integration Work

1. [ ] **Copy Functionality Implementation**
   - System clipboard integration with native copy operations
   - Visual feedback for successful copy actions
   - Keyboard shortcut support (Ctrl/Cmd+C)

2. [ ] **Application Packaging**
   - Cross-platform Electron packaging (macOS, Windows, Linux)
   - Code signing for distribution
   - Installer creation and distribution preparation

3. [ ] **Performance Optimization**
   - Context generation performance tuning
   - Application startup time optimization
   - Memory usage optimization for long-running sessions

## Implementation Order Rationale

**Phase 1: Foundation (Items 1-4)**
- Must be completed before any feature work can begin
- Establishes core architecture and development patterns
- Reduces risk by validating technical stack early

**Phase 2: Core Features (Slices 1-2)**
- Basic Context Generation provides immediate user value
- Project Configuration enables single-project workflow
- Together they create a minimally viable application

**Phase 3: Multi-Project Features (Slice 3)**
- Builds on proven single-project patterns
- Adds significant user value for multi-project workflows
- Higher complexity requires stable foundation

**Phase 4: Enhanced Features (Slices 4-5)**
- Template Selection and Context Customization add polish
- Can be developed in parallel once core features are stable
- Lower risk, higher user experience value

**Phase 5: Integration and Polish**
- Copy functionality completes core user workflow
- Packaging enables distribution
- Performance optimization based on real usage patterns

## Notes

**Key Planning Decisions:**
- Started with single-project workflow before multi-project to reduce complexity
- Template system separated from core generation to allow independent development
- Real-time preview treated as enhancement rather than core feature

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
- **All-in-one slice:** Rejected due to size and complexity
- **Database storage:** Rejected in favor of simple JSON files for MVP
- **Web-based version:** Considered as fallback but Electron chosen for better desktop integration

**Open Questions for Later Phases:**
- Template template system extensibility (user-defined templates)
- Export/import functionality for project configurations
- Advanced context formatting options
- Integration with external project management tools

**Slice Dependencies Summary:**
```
Foundation Work (1-4) → Basic Context Generation (1) → Project Configuration (2)
                                     ↓                           ↓
Template Selection (4) ← Multi-Project Support (3) ← Project Configuration (2)
         ↓                           ↓
Context Customization (5) ← Multi-Project Support (3)
```

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Medium-risk slices scheduled early to surface technical challenges
- Each slice delivers demonstrable user value
- Clear rollback points if any slice proves problematic
- Foundation work validates all major technical decisions
