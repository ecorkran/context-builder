# Maintenance Slice: context-builder

## Overview

This slice addresses ongoing maintenance tasks, bug fixes, and improvements for the context-builder Electron application. This includes resolving system-level issues, improving developer experience, and maintaining code quality.

## Current Issues

### 1. TIPropertyValueIsValid macOS Error

**Priority:** P2 (Non-critical system warning)
**Status:** Postponed Indefinitely

**Description:** 
Application shows macOS-specific warnings in the console:
```
_TIPropertyValueIsValid called with 16 on nil context!
imkxpc_getApplicationProperty:reply: called with incorrect property value 16, bailing.
Text input context does not respond to _valueForTIProperty:
```

**Analysis:**
- This is a macOS system warning related to text input handling in Electron applications
- Occurs when non-English input methods (particularly Chinese input) are active
- Does not affect application functionality or user experience
- Common issue across Electron applications on macOS

**Root Cause:**
- macOS Text Input Manager (TIM) property conflicts with Electron's text input handling
- Triggered by input method switching or certain keyboard layouts
- Related to property value 16 (or variants like 4) being passed to nil context

**Impact:**
- Cosmetic: Console warning messages during development
- No functional impact on the application
- No user-facing issues

**Solutions Available:**
1. **Input Method Switch** (User-level workaround)
   - Switch to English input method to eliminate warnings
   - Temporary solution, may reoccur with input method changes

2. **Electron Configuration** (Development-level mitigation)
   - Investigate Electron webPreferences settings for input handling
   - Research nodeIntegration and contextIsolation configurations

3. **Suppress Warnings** (Development-level)
   - Filter console output during development
   - Add logging configuration to suppress specific warnings

## Success Criteria

- [ ] TIPropertyValueIsValid error analysis documented
- [ ] Potential solutions researched and documented
- [ ] Recommendation provided for handling approach
- [ ] Decision made on whether to fix or document as known issue

## Implementation Notes

**Recommended Approach:**
Given that this is a cosmetic issue with no functional impact and affects only development console output, the recommended approach is to:

1. Document the issue as a known limitation
2. Provide user guidance for eliminating warnings if desired
3. Monitor for Electron framework updates that might resolve the issue
4. Consider implementing console filtering for development environment

**Alternative Approaches:**
- Deep Electron configuration changes (high risk, low reward)
- Custom input handling implementation (unnecessary complexity)
- Upstream bug reports to Electron team (appropriate for framework-level issue)

## Dependencies

- No direct dependencies on other slices
- May reference development tooling and build configuration

## Risks

- **Low Risk:** This is a cosmetic issue with no functional impact
- **Investigation Risk:** Minimal - primarily research and documentation
- **Implementation Risk:** If pursuing technical fixes, risk of introducing actual functional issues

## Testing Strategy

- No specific testing required for documentation-only approach
- If implementing technical solutions, test across multiple macOS versions and input methods
- Verify no regression in text input functionality

## Documentation Requirements

- Update development documentation with known issue information
- Provide user guidance for eliminating warnings
- Document any implemented solutions or workarounds
